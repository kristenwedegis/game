	<h2>Hades is the eldest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. When the time came for his brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and himself to fight and overturn their father, the three came out triumphant. It was then that the three took control of all elements of the Cosmos. Zeus took over as ruler of the skies, Posiedon was made ruler of the seas, and lastly Hades was left to tend to the Underworld. Little did Persephone know when she opened the door to Hadesâ€™ lair that Hercules had just made a valiant appearance to steal away his three-headed guard dog Cerberus as his 12th and final labor, so to say the least, he was in no mood for guests.</h2>
